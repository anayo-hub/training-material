# Introduction

 One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. 
 When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. 
Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.
  
#### To share a history, click on the `galaxy-gear` {% icon galaxy-gear %} icon in the history panel and select Share or Publish. you can do 3 things:

- (a) `Make History Accessible via Link`. This generates a link that you can give out to others. Anybody with this link will be able to view your history.
- (b) `Make History Accessible and Publish`. This will not only create a link, but will also publish your history.This means your history will be listed under `Shared Data â†’ Histories` in the top menu.
- (c) `Share with a user`. This will share the history only with specific users on the Galaxy instance.

 you can always check your `shared history` on top to see shared histories
 - you can Share one of your histories with your neighbour. and you can do the same with your workflow!
